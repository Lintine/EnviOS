# XianZaiOS
# :warning: Superior disclaimer
The disclaimer I wrote below was when I was tired and pissed off, but those weren't the reasons I stopped developing XianZaiOS. I kinda started off on the wrong foot with the project.

But now I am proud to announce to you guys that two new OSes are in the works: [ArctineOS](https://icycoide.github.io/arctine-docs/) and [ElemintOS](https://icycoide.github.io/ElemintOS/)

# :warning: Disclaimer
Before we dive into the website, I just want to tell about what happened to this """distro""".

I'm completely giving up on XianZaiOS. It's completely pointless, useless and unnecessary.

I mean, first of all, it's just ubuntu with a lot of sprinkles on top, but it's also like that with other distros which people deny to admit since their devs are actually "making something unique" while XianZaiOS "just slaps a DE and calls it a day".

Next, All of the shit in XianZaiOS could have been installed with **A**dvanced **P**ackaging **T**ool. literally.

And not last, neither least, Was it really ever a distro? or just a shitty ISO of Ubuntu? It was never a distro.

Now for XZPaqu√©, it's staying with the "XZ" at the beginning.

Sayonara, XianZaiOS
